# Five Minute Chat Web App

Have you ever wondered if a 5-minute conversation is enough to get to know someone? <br>

## How it works

When you go to the website it will give you a random generated code. <br>
* You can share that code with someone
* Click "start the chat"
* You will be given a random nickname (Could be great conversation starter)

For the other person, they can put in the shared code in the given space.
* Click "start the chat"
* Join in the conversation of other person
* You will also be given a random nickname

Enjoy the chat
